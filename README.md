# Getting Data for Machine-Learning


This Jupyter Book is all about using Python to obtain data for use in your machine learning projects. This was especially made for those starting out as Data Engineers or ML Engineers who want to learn how to generate test data, and where to find data, extract, and prepare them for analysis and modeling.
